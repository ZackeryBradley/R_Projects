#== Question 1 part 5
<!--
Date Created: Use today’s date in 2021-07-05 format
Description: Add a few sentences that includes what the program is doing, files you plan to use, where you 
got them, etc. For this project, add the following text under description:
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS 
Word documents. The following is just a sample of some of the things you can do with R Markdown.
Modified: 
This will not have anything now but will be useful if you make changes in the future to a document. For this 
project, put today’s date (in 2021-07-05 format) and type created 
-->

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown Coding Tips

* [Github](https://github.com)
* [stackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)
* [Reddit](https://www.Reddit.com)

### **Chunks of Code**

**Options include**:

* **eval = FALSE** prevents the code from being evaluate (not run and no output created) this is useful if you want to stop a chunk of code from running but you will probably not use this in the course.

* **include = FALSE** runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. 
Use for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report.
* **echo = FALSE** prevents code (but not results) from appearing in the finished report. Useful 
when presenting to management so the code doesn’t show on report.
* **message = FALSE or warning = FALSE** prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the 
output file
* **results = ‘hide’** hides printed output.
* **fig.show = ‘hide’** hides plots.
* **error = TRUE** causes the render to continue even if the code returns an error (rarely used).

### **Packages and Data Imports in R**

#==Question 2 part 7

A few tips when working with packages in Markdown include:

* Don't install a package in your Markdown file. This will install the package everytime the file is knit. to load new packages, do this in the console outside of the Markdown file.
- If a new package does need to be installed, include this in the comments at the top of your R Markdown file.
- If a new package does need to be installed, include this in the comments at the top of your R 
Markdown file.
+ You only need to load the library once in the Markdown file. So, if you are using tidyverse, you 
will only have library(tidyverse) included once at the beginning.
* When you load some packages, they actually have multiple packages included in the load. For 
example, when you load tidyverse, this will load ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, etc.

#==Question 2 part 8

### **Examples**

#==question 2 part 9

For this project, we will be using the tidyverse which you just installed in a previous assignment. 
Remember that when you load a package in R, it will remain loaded throughout the program (you 
don’t need to continually load the package).
Below is an example of loading the package and importing the data:

#==question 2 part 10

```{r **packages**}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
US_Population_1_ <- read_csv("C:/Users/bradl/OneDrive/Desktop/US_Population (1).csv")
```
